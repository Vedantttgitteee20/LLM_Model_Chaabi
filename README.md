# LLM Model Chaabi

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of a BERT-based language model for some task related to Chaabi. The model is hosted using Gradio for easy interaction. Alternatively all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model is also used to explore.

## Hosting the Application on Gradio
This project utilizes Gradio for hosting and interacting with the machine learning models. Gradio is a Python library that simplifies the process of creating user interfaces for machine learning models, making it easy to share and showcase your models with a wider audience.
